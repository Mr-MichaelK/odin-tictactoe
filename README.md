# odin-tictactoe

The purpose of this project is to build a Tic Tac Toe game using modular JS to minimize the number of global variables and separate state logic from UI control.

The first stage of the game would be only playable in the console, for the purpose of highlighting the independence of the game's functionality from the DOM.

The second stage of the game will be playable on the webpage, to show that the code is written in a systematic method that allows its portability.
